        <h2>I'm a <span class="highlight">Data Scientist</span></h2>
        <p>Creative problem-solver and data storyteller with a master's in Applied Data Science and a passion for turning noise into narrative. I build models that don't just predict â€” they persuade. From wrangling messy datasets to presenting insights that reshape business direction, I bridge the technical and the human. My toolkit spans Python, SQL, and machine learning, but my superpower lies in translating complexity into clarity â€” dashboards that make sense, models that drive action, and solutions that scale. I'm here to deliver impact, not just output.</p>

        <h2>About </h2>
        <p>I'm a Data Scientist who believes that great insights start with great questions â€” not just great code. With an MSc in Applied Data Science and hands-on experience in both analytical and machine learning roles, Iâ€™ve developed a passion for solving real-world problems where data meets people.</p>
    
        <p>I love the full pipeline â€” from digging into raw, unstructured data to delivering clean, interactive dashboards or predictive models that actually change how decisions are made. Whether Iâ€™m building a churn model, visualizing regional crime patterns, or automating reporting with Python and SQL, my goal is always the same: make data make sense.</p>
    
        <p>What sets me apart is my ability to think like a product owner, not just a data scientist. I don't just ask what the data says â€” I ask why it matters. That means aligning with business goals, speaking the language of non-technical stakeholders, and always thinking about impact before complexity.</p>
    
        <p>Outside of work, Iâ€™m a lifelong learner who enjoys exploring how data intersects with human behavior, public policy, and design. Youâ€™ll often find me experimenting with new visualization tools, reading up on decision science, or simplifying machine learning concepts for friends who think AI is magic. (Itâ€™s not â€” but it sure feels like it sometimes.)</p>
